```

- ✅ **99 static pages generated** (84 dynamic service/neighborhood combinations)
- ✅ **Small bundle sizes** (under 1KB for most routes)
- ✅ **Efficient code splitting** with shared chunks
- ✅ **Zero build errors or warnings**

## Performance Improvements

### Core Web Vitals Optimizations
1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   - Hero image optimized with priority loading
   - Font preloading implemented
   - Critical CSS inlined

2. **First Input Delay (FID)**
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Reduced JavaScript bundle size
   - Optimized event handlers

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
   - Proper image dimensions specified
   - Skeleton loading states added
   - Font display swap implemented

### Network Optimizations
- DNS prefetching for external resources
- Preconnect hints for Google Fonts
- Optimized image formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Compressed assets enabled

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### 1. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
- Consider implementing Vercel Edge Network or Cloudflare
- Cache static assets with long expiration times

### 2. **Database Optimization**
- If adding dynamic content, consider implementing ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Use database connection pooling for better performance

### 3. **Monitoring & Analytics**
- Implement Web Vitals monitoring
- Add performance tracking with tools like Lighthouse CI
- Consider adding error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)

### 4. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Implement app manifest for mobile installation
- Add push notifications for appointment reminders
